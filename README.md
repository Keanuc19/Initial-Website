# Initial-Website

Creator : Keanu Chetty 
Title : Cyber Punk themed online store 
Languages : CSS, HTML , JavaScript

this was my final project for my Web Development Course, I utilized Css and JavaScript with the animations to create a smoother experience. 
Due to time constraints the web site wasn't perfect but i took it as a good opportunity to learn the core concepts. We brushed up on PHP concepts but didn't do any practical application of it.

Future Objectives 
- Allow website to communicate with a Database.
- better functionality with shopping cart and item choices.
- less reference files in the future.
